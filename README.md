# STATS 700, Fall 2025

This half semester courseÂ will cover some "recent hits" in learning theory. After quickly discussing some background material in classical learning theory, both statistical and online, we will look at some recent progress (even some breakthroughs!) in fundamental problems like:
- sample compression schemes
- multiclass classification
- private learning
- operator learning
- learning from quantum examples
- generation

No prior background in learning theory is required. But a high level of mathematical maturity will be needed to fully benefit from this course. The topics list below is tentative and subject to change.
