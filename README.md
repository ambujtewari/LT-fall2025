# STATS 700, Fall 2025

This half semester courseÂ will cover some "recent hits" in learning theory. After quickly discussing some background material in classical learning theory, both statistical and online, we will look at some recent progress (even some breakthroughs!) in fundamental problems like: multiclass classification, differentially private learning, operator learning, quantum learning, and generation. No prior background in learning theory is required. But a high level of mathematical maturity will be needed to fully benefit from this course. A more detailed syllabus will be eventually posted at this webpage.
